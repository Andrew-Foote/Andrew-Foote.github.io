<h1>What is it used for?</h1>
<p>The Arabic script is a script that originated in the Middle East and was used to write Classical Arabic. It is written right-to-left, and is an abjad: it mainly leaves out vowels and just writes consonants. Today it is used for the following languages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>all the languages of the Arabic family, except Maltese which is written in Latin,</li>
	<li>the Berber languages, traditionally. Berber languages are also often written in Latin, preferred by the French-speaking colonial elite and for scientific purposes, while a revived version of the ancient Tifinagh script used in Roman times has recently started to be used among Berber activists.</li>
	<li>many North African languages, with varying degrees of use. The Beja language of Sudan is written exclusively in Arabic. The Nubian languages are rarely written, and when they are they may be written in Arabic script, the Latin alphabet or the ancient Nubian script.</li>
	<li>many West African languages, such as Hausa, Mandinka, Fula and Wolof, use the Latin alphabet officially, but tend to be more commonly written in Arabic script introduced in pre-colonial times.</li>
	<li>the Somali language, historically. Since the 1970s, a Latin alphabet has been used.</li>
	<li>Swahili was historically written in the Arabic alphabet, until Christians became more dominant than Muslims in this region of Africa. In the Comoros, where the Comorian variant of Swahili is spoken, Arabic script is still used alongside Latin.</li>
	<li>Persian and many closely-related Iranian languages such as Dari, Balochi, Pashto and Tajik, as well as the Turkic language Azerbaijani.</li>
	<li>Kurdish in Iraq and Iran (the Kurds in Turkey and Syria use the Latin alphabet).</li>
	<li>Kazakh. However, in the former Soviet Union and countries influenced by it (Kazakhstan and Mongolia) Kazakhs have switched to the Cyrillic alphabet. Arabic script is still used for the Kazakh minorities in other countries, mainly China.</li>
	<li>Kyrgyz, which like Kazakh switched to Cyrillic in Kyrgyzstan. In China, the Arabic script is still used to write Kyrgyz.</li>
	<li>Uyghur, which is in a similar situation to Kazakh and Kyrgyz: although most Uyghur speakers are in China and use Arabic script, those in Kazakhstan have switched to Cyrillic. A Pinyin-based Latin alphabet was adopted in the latter half of the 20th century for the Chinese speakers, but they have since switched back to Arabic and this alphabet is no longer used much. An entirely different Latin alphabet has been developed even more recently, but this is only intended to make it easier to use Uyghur on computers.</li>
	<li>The Salar language in China is generally written in Arabic script, although various other scripts are used, including Chinese characters and Latin, and there is no standardisation.</li>
	<li>Some Chinese Muslims (Hui) write Mandarin Chinese in the Arabic script. This is declining sharply in modern times, but it still happens. The Hui who fled to the Russian Empire in the 1870s, known as the Dungans, originally used this script to, but they have switched to Cyrillic and then Latin.</li>
	<li>Some Indic languages: Hindustani in Pakistan (Hindustani is known as Urdu when written in Arabic, and Hindi when written in Devanagari), Sindhi and Kashmiri in Pakistan, Punjabi (where the Arabic "Shahmukhi" script exists alongside the Indic "Gurmukhi" script). Even some Malayalam and Tamil Muslims use Arabic for their respective languages.</li>
	<li>Malay, for which the Latin script is also used. Latin is the most common script for Malay in everyday contexts, with the Arabic script ("Jawi") tending to be restricted to religious environments. The Arabic script for Malay is most common in Brunei.</li>
</ul>
<p>Languages formerly written in Arabic include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Various languages in Central Asia: Uzbek, Turkmen and Karakalpak all used Arabic script historically, then switched to Cyrillic in Soviet times and have recently switched again to Latin.</li>
	<li>Most other Muslim peoples in the former Soviet Union, such as the Avar, Chechen, Bashkir and Circassians, originally used Arabic then switched to Cyrillic.</li>
	<li>Crimean Tatar has a similar history. Originally written in Arabic, it was switched to Latin for a short time in the Soviet era, then to Cyrillic, and since the end of the Soviet Union has started to switch back to Latin.</li>
	<li>Turkish was originally written in Arabic script in the time of the Ottoman Empire. After that state collapsed, a drastic change was instituted in the language, which included a switch from Arabic to Latin script.</li>
	<li>Up to the 20th century, Bosnian was often written in Arabic, as well as Cyrillic. The modern language uses Latin.</li>
	<li>Some Tatars used the Arabic script to write local Slavic languages, such as Polish or Belarusian.</li>
	<li>The Albanian language had no standard writing system for a long time, and Arabic, Greek, Cyrillic and Latin scripts were all used. Modern Albanian is written in the Latin alphabet.</li>
	<li>Malagasy was written in an Arabic script known as "Sorabe" in pre-colonial times.</li>
	<li>Occasionally in pre-colonial times, the Arabic script was used to write the Songhay language. It is now written in Latin.</li>
	<li>Afrikaans, the variant of Dutch spoken in South Africa, was written in Arabic by some Malay Muslim speakers.</li>
	<li>In Muslim Spain, the Arabic script was used to write the Arabic-influenced Romance languages that developed there.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The alphabet</h1>
<p>This is the Arabic alphabet as used for the Arabic language. In Arabic, most of the letters have an initial, medial, final and isolated form which look different. The initial form is used when the letter starts a word (i.e. it's the rightmost letter), the final form is used when the letter ends a word (i.e. it's the leftmost letter), the medial form is used elsewhere, while the isolated form is used when a letter both starts and ends a word. A few letters only have final and isolated forms; with these, the following (i.e. on the left) character is always in the initial or isolated form, as if there was a word break between them.</p>
<p>The letters are given here in the <i>hijā’ī</i> order, which groups letters by similarities in their shape. This is the most common order used in dictionaries and other reference books. There is also the <i>’abjadī</i> order, a continuation of the original Phoenician alphabet order and therefore similar to the order of the Latin alphabet. There are also variants for each of these orders. Here they are (written right to left, as all Arabic text is):</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Most common <i>’abjadī</i> sequence</dt>
	<dd><span lang="ar">أبجدهوزحطيكلمنسعفصقرشتثخذضظغ</span> (this can be read as <i>’abjad hawwaz ḥuṭṭī kalaman sa‘faṣ qarashat thakhadh ḍaẓagh</i> or <i>’abujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman sa‘faṣ qurishat thakhudh ḍaẓugh</i>)</dd>
	<dt>Older <i>’abjadī</i> sequence, used mainly in the Maghreb</dt>
	<dd><span lang="ar">أبجدهوزحطيكلمنصعفضقرستثخذظغش</span> (this can be read as <i>’abujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman ṣa‘faḍ qurisat thakhudh ẓaghush</i>)</dd>
	<dt><i>hijā’ī</i> sequence</dt>
	<dd><span lang="ar">أبتثجحخدذرزسشصضطظعغفقكلمنهوي</span></dd>
	<dt>Maghrebi <i>hijā’ī</i> sequence variant, now obsolete</dt>
	<dd><span lang="ar">أبتثجحخدذرزطظكلمنصضعغفقسشهوي</span></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is the detailed alphabet in <i>hijā’ī</i> order:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>’alif</i> <span lang="ar">ـا ا</span></dt>
	<dd>This is descended from the Phoenician letter which represented /ʔ/ (a sound not distinctive in English, but found in most British dialects for <i>t</i> in words like <i>Gatwick</i>). In Arabic, it is still used for this sound, but also the long vowel /aː/ (roughly like the <i>a</i> in the British pronunciation of <i>father</i>). This use of this letter in Arabic is the most complicated of them all, except perhaps for the <i>hamza</i>.
	<ul>
		<li>Plain <i>’alif</i> is usually /aː/.</li>
		<li>Initially, it is shortened, and may also represent /i/ as well as /a/. With a <i>hamza</i> diacritic below (<span lang="ar">ـإ إ</span>), it represents /ʔi/; this diacritic in this position is not used on <i>’alif</i> in any other position. In some contexts, initial /a/ is dropped from words; when this happens the alif gains a diacritic known as the <i>waṣlah</i> and becomes <span lang="ar">ـٱ ٱ</span>.</li>
		<li>With a <i>hamzah</i> diacritic above (<span lang="ar">ـأ أ</span>), it represents /ʔa/. Initially, this may also represent /ʔu/. To represent glottal stops next to different vowels, see the entry for <i>hamza</i>.</li>
		<li>There is a special diacritic known as the <i>maddah</i> which should be used where you would write a double <i>’alif</i> to represent /ʔaː/. It looks like a tilde: <span lang="ar">آ‎ ـآ</span>‎.</li>
		<li>Some words, instead of writing an <i>’alif</i> on its own, place it as a diacritic (<span lang="ar">ٰ◌</span>) on the preceding consonant. This is only in a few words, and unpredictable. This diacritic  always represents /aː/.</li>
	</ul></dd>
<dt><i>bā’</i> <span lang="ar">بـ ـبـ ـب ب</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents the sound /b/. It is also used in loanwords for /p/ (which is usually pronounced the same as /b/ in Arabic speech anyway).</dd>
<dt><i>tā’</i> <span lang="ar">تـ ـتـ ـت ت</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents the sound /t/. A special form known as <i>tā marbuta</i> (ة ـة) is used for the word-final ending that indicates feminine gender on nouns and adjectives.</dd>
<dt><i>thā’</i> <span lang="ar">ثـ ـثـ ـث ث</span></dt>
	<dd>The canonical pronunciation of this letter is /θ/ (first sound in <i>thick</i>). However, it has changed to be pronounced as /t/ outside of the Gulf, Iraqi and Tunisian dialects, where /θ/ is retained even in colloquial speech. It is also pronounced as /s/ in some literary words, as a re-borrowing of the original /θ/ sound, but only in the Mashriq. The very highest register of educated Arabic will always use /θ/, but the /t/ and /s/ pronunciations are quite standard.</dd>
<dt><i>jīm</i> <span lang="ar">جـ ـجـ ـج ج</span></dt>
	<dd>This generally represents /d͡ʒ/ (first sound in <i>jump</i>), and this is the standard pronunciation in Arabic, and used even in colloquial speech in Iraq and Algeria. Classical Arabic probably had a sound more like [gʲ] or [ɟ] (roughly like the middle consonant cluster in <i>argue</i>), and this is still retained in some dialects among Bedouins and in the Sudan or Yemen. In some other Yemeni dialects and Egypt, it is pronounced [g], and elsewhere in the Maghreb and in the Levant, it's [ʒ] (the French <i>j</i> sound, also found in English in <i>measure</i>). In Kuwait and the Gulf dialects it may weaken completely to [j] (English <i>y</i>), but only in the most colloquial dialects.</dd>
<dt><i>ḥā’</i> <span lang="ar">حـ ـحـ ـح ح</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /ħ/, a sound not found in English or any other well-known European language. It is basically a pharyngeal version of /h/, though this doesn't help if you don't know what pharyngeal consonants sound like.</dd>
<dt><i>khā’</i> <span lang="ar">خـ ـخـ ـخ خ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /x/ (often pronounced more like [χ]), like the Scouse pronunciation of the <i>ck</i> in <i>back</i>, or the <i>ch</i> in German <i>Bauch</i>, or the <i>j</i> in Spanish <i>junta</i>.</dd>
<dt><i>dāl</i> <span lang="ar">دـ ـدـ ـد د</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /d/.</dd>
<dt><i>dhāl</i> <span lang="ar">ذـ ـذـ ـذ ذ</span></dt>
	<dd>This is canonically pronounced as /ð/ (first sound in <i>there</i>). It is the voiced counterpart of /θ/ and varies with /d/ or /z/ in the same way that /θ/ varies with /t/ or /s/.</dd>
<dt><i>rā’</i> <span lang="ar">ـر ر</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /r/, which in Arabic is variably pronounced as a trill (as in Spanish <i>perro</i>) or a tap (as in Spanish <i>pero</i>), not like the English <i>r</i>.</dd>
<dt><i>zayn</i> <span lang="ar">ـز ز</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /z/.</dd>
<dt><i>sīn</i> <span lang="ar">سـ ـسـ ـس س</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /s/.</dd>
<dt><i>shīn</i> <span lang="ar">شـ ـشـ ـش ش</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /ʃ/ (the English <i>sh</i> sound).</dd>
<dt><i>ṣād</i> <span lang="ar">صـ ـصـ ـص ص</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /sˤ/, a pharyngealised version of /s/ (the pharyngealised consonants are also known as emphatic consonants). No familiar European language has pharyngeal consonants, so you'll just have to hear what this sounds like.</dd>
<dt><i>ḍād</i> <span lang="ar">ضـ ـضـ ـض ض</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents a sound generally pronounced now as /dˤ/, a pharyngealised version of /d/. Based on descriptions of the sound by early Arabs, and the fact that cognate words in the South Arabian languages have /ɬʼ/ for this sound, it is reasonably certain that it was actually pronounced something like /ɬˤ/ in classical times (like a pharyngealised version of the <i>ll</i> in Welsh <i>Llanberis</i>). Nobody pronounces it like this today though.</dd>
<dt><i>ṭā’</i> <span lang="ar">طـ ـطـ ـط ط</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /tˤ/, the pharyngealised version of /t/.</dd>
<dt><i>‘ayn</i> <span lang="ar">عـ ـعـ ـع ع</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /ʕ/, the basic pharyngeal sound. Don't confuse this with /ʔ/&mdash;/ʕ/ is like a pharyngeal version of /ʔ/, just as /ħ/ is a pharyngeal version of /h/. There is really nothing like this sound in English or any European language&mdash;at least for /ħ/ you have /h/&mdash;you'll just have to hear what it sounds like. (Or study phonetics.)</dd>
<dt><i>ghayn</i> <span lang="ar">غـ ـغـ ـغ غ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /ɣ/, which also varies with [ʁ]. This is the voiced counterparts of /x/; voiced means it is to /x/ as /b/ is to /p/, or /d/ to /t/, or /z/ to /s/, or /v/ to /f/. The <i>r</i> sound in French and German, when not pronounced emphatically as a trill, is pronounced [ʁ]. The Dutch <i>g</i>, and Spanish <i>g</i> between vowels, are pronounced like /ɣ/. Arabic has no letter for plain /g/, so this letter is used in loanwords that originally had /g/, and it may be pronounced as /g/ here by educated speakers. However, in Egypt where they pronounce <i>jīm</i> as [g], they use that letter to write /g/ in loanwords.</dd>
<dt><i>fā’</i> <span lang="ar">فـ ـفـ ـف ف</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /f/. It is also used for /v/ sounds in loanwords, since Arabic does not use this sound, although educated speakers will often pronounce /v/ distinct from /f/. Traditionally in northwestern Africa, a variant of this letter is used with the dot below: <span lang="ar">ڢ ـڢ ـڢـ ڢـ‎</span>.</dd>
<dt><i>qāf</i> <span lang="ar">قـ ـقـ ـق ق</span></dt>
	<dd>The standard pronunciation of this is /q/, a sound which is not found in any familiar European language, although if you know the difference between [x] and [χ], or [ɣ] and [ʁ], the difference between [k] and [q] is analogous. /k/ is a reasonable approximation, but Arabic speakers do distinguish between the two sounds. Though /q/ is standard, many Arabs have difficulty with the sound too, since they pronounce it differently in their dialects: Egyptians pronounce it as /ʔ/, south Egyptians as well as people in most of the Maghreb and parts of Jordan and Yemen pronounce it as /g/, people from Sudan and other parts of Yemen pronounce it as [ɢ] (which is to [g] as [q] is to [k]), people from Palestine pronounce it as /k/, Gulf dialect speakers pronounce it as /d͡ʒ/. In northwestern Africa, a variant of this letter is used with only one dot, and the dot is dropped entirely in the final and isolated forms: <span lang="ar">ڧـ ـڧـ ـٯ ٯ</span>.</dd>
<dt><i>kāf</i> <span lang="ar">كـ ـكـ ـك ك</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /k/, although rural dialect speakers in Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait and the Gulf may pronounce it as [t͡ʃ] (English <i>ch</i>).</dd>
<dt><i>lām</i> <span lang="ar">لـ ـلـ ـل ل</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /l/.</dd>
<dt><i>mīm</i> <span lang="ar">مـ ـمـ ـم م</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /m/.</dd>
<dt><i>nūn</i> <span lang="ar">نـ ـنـ ـن ن</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /n/.</dd>
<dt><i>hā’</i> <span lang="ar">هـ ـهـ ـه ه</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /h/.</dd>
<dt><i>wāw</i> <span lang="ar">ـو و</span></dt>
	<dd>This letter represents /w/, and also the long vowel /uː/ (roughly as in English <i>lose</i>) and the diphthong /aw/ (as in English <i>house</i>, although many Arabic speakers pronounce /aw/ as [oː], like a Scottish pronunciation of <i>nose</i>). It is mostly ambiguous, although it can be relied upon as always /w/ at the start of a word, and if vowel diacritics are being used you can distinguish /uː/ and /aw/ by the preceding consonant's diacritic.
<dt><i>yā’</i> <span lang="ar">يـ ـيـ ـي ي</span></dt>
	<dd>This letter represents /j/, and also the long vowel /iː/ (roughly as in English <i>cheese</i>) and the diphthong /aj/ (as in English <i>dice</i>, although many Arabic speakers pronounce /aj/ as [eː], like a Scottish pronunciation of <i>maze</i>). The rules for distinguishing these are the same as with <i>wāw</i>. In some words, word-final /aː/ is written with a <i>’alif maqṣūrah</i> (<span lang="ar">ـى ى</span>), which is really a dotless version of <i>yā’</i>. In most words, plain <i>’alif</i> is used for word-final /aː/ as you would expect. In Egypt and the Sudan, all word-final <i>yā’</i> are written like <i>’alif maqṣūrah</i>, with no dots, meaning /iː/ and /aː/ are not distinguished at the end of words.</dd>
<dt><i>hamza</i> <span lang="ar">ء</span></dt>
	<dd>This is not a proper letter, but a diacritic that is sometimes written without any letter combined to it; so it only has an isolated form. It represents the glottal stop /ʔ/. The rules for it are very complex:
	<ul>
		<li>At the start of a word, <i>hamza</i> is written as a diacritic on an <i>’alif</i>. The diacritic is below the <i>’alif</i> (<span lang="ar">ـإ إ</span>) if the following vowel is /i/, otherwise above the <i>’alif</i> (<span lang="ar">ـأ أ</span>). Word-initial glottal stops are always written like this, unless followed by /aː/ in which case the <i>’alif maddah</i> is used.</li>
		<li>At the end of a word (as a letter, not as a sound&mdash;any word-final vowels are ignored), <i>hamza</i> is written over the symbol for the corresponding long vowel if the /ʔ/ is preceded by short /i u a/ (i.e. /iʔ/ is <span lang="ar">ئـ ـئـ ـئ ئ</span> [note that the two dots below disappear when <i>hamza</i> is added], /uʔ/ is <span lang="ar">ـؤ ؤ</span>, /aʔ/ is <span lang="ar">ـأ أ</span>). If no short vowel precedes, the <i>hamza</i> is written in its standalone <span lang="ar">ء</span> form.</li>
		<li>In the middle of a word, the rules are as follows. If a long vowel or diphthong precedes, look at the following vowel. If it is /i/, use <i>yā’ hamza</i>, and if it is /u/, use <i>wāw hamza</i>. Otherwise, the <i>hamza</i> is generally standalone, unless it follows a <i>yā’</i> in which case it is written over this, since otherwise it would be awkward to write. In other cases, if there is only one adjacent vowel, the hamza is placed over the appropriate symbol for that vowel (<i>yā’</i> for /i(ː)/, <i>wāw</i> for /u(ː)/, <i>’alif</i> for /a(ː)/). If there are two adjacent vowels, there is a sort of hierarchy of which determines how the <i>hamza</i> is written: /i/ before /u a/ and /u/ before /a/. </li>
	</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>As well as these basic letters, there is a compulsory ligature used for <i>lām</i> followed by <i>’alif</i>: <span lang="ar">ـلا لا</span>.</p>

<p>Also, geminate (long) consonants in Arabic as in <i>maddah</i> are not written out as two letters; this would imply there's a vowel between them. Instead a diacritic called the <i>shaddah</i> (<span lang="ar">ّ◌</span>) is used to double the consonant.</p>

<p>Arabic does not normally write short vowels. But sometimes it does&mdash;for example in materials for teaching Arabic, or in books for children, or in the <i>Qur’ān</i>. The vowels are written as diacritics under the preceding consonant; Arabic has no words that begin in a vowel. The diacritics are the <i>kasrah</i> for /i/ (<span lang="ar">ِ◌ِ</span>), the <i>ḍammah</i> for /u/ (<span lang="ar">ُ◌</span>) and the <i>fatḥah</i> for /a/ (<span lang="ar">َ◌</span>). In texts that use these vowel diacritics, they are also written on consonants that precede a long vowel, e.g. <i>fā</i> would be written <span lang="ar">فَا</span>.</p>

<p>When these vowel diacritics are added to a consonant that has the <i>shaddah</i> mark, they are added on to the <i>shaddah</i>. So <i>kasrah shaddah</i> is <span lang="ar">‎ِّ◌ِّ</span>, <i>‎ḍammah shaddah</i> is <span lang="ar">ُّ◌</span>, <i>fatḥah shaddah</i> is <span lang="ar">َّ◌</span>.</p>

<p>In the indefinite case endings, a final /n/ after a short vowel is indicated by writing the vowel's diacritic twice: <i>in</i> is <span lang="ar">ٍ◌</span>, <i>un</i> is <span lang="ar">ٌ◌</span>, <i>an</i> is <span lang="ar">ً◌</span>.</p>

<p>There is another diacritic called the <i>sukūn</i> (ْ◌) which is used to indicate that no vowel follows a consonant. Any consonant in a consonant cluster, other than the last one, should have the <i>sukūn</i> above it, and so should any word-final consonants (however, in spoken Arabic many word-final vowels are left out, so from a speaker's perspective it is unpredictable whether final consonants take a <i>sukūn</i> ). Diphthongs can be distinguished from regular long vowels due to the <i>sukūn</i>&mdash;diphthongs will have a <i>sukūn</i> on the <i>yā’</i> or <i>wāw</i>.</p>
<section>
<h2>Additions to the alphabet</h2>
<p>For many of the languages which the Arabic script has been adapted for, additional letters have been introduced. Here is a list.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><i>"vā’"</i> <span lang="ar">ڤـ ـڤـ ـڤ ڤ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /v/, used in Kurdish and sometimes for loanwords in Arabic. It's <i>fā’</i> with two extra dots, and as with that letter, northwestern Africans use a variant with the dots below: <span lang="ar">ڥـ ـڥـ ـڥ ڥ</span>.</dd>
	<dt>Tunisian <i>"gāf"</i> <span lang="ar">ڨ‎ ـڨ‎ ـڨـ‎ ڨـ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /g/. It's only used in Tunisia, and less commonly in Algeria, for /g/ in loanwords. Some speakers may use it to represent their dialectal pronunciation of <i>qāf</i>.</dd>
	<dt><i>"pā’"</i> <span lang="ar">پـ ـپـ ـپ پ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /p/, and is used by Iranian, Indian and Turkic languages, as well as Arabic in loanwords (sometimes).</dd>
	<dt><i>"chīm"</i> <span lang="ar">چـ ـچـ ـچ چ</span></dt>
	<dd>This is used for the /t͡ʃ/ sound found in Iranian and Indian languages, as well as English, where it is usually written <i>ch</i>. It is also used to represent Gulf and Iraqi dialectal pronunciations of <i>kāf</i>. As well as this, it is also used in Israel to represent /g/ when transcribing foreign words (especially from Hebrew). Arabic speakers generally do not use this letter for /t͡ʃ/ in loanwords, but instead use <i>tā’</i> followed by <i>shīn</i> for this purpose.</dd>
	<dt><i>chīn</i> <span lang="ar">ڜـ ـڜـ ـڜ ڜ</span></dt>
	<dd>This also represents /t͡ʃ/. It is only used in Morocco.</dd>
	<dt>Iranian <i>gāf</i> <span lang="ar">گـ ـگـ ـگ گ</span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /g/, and is used in Iranian and Indian languages. It is not used in Arabic itself.</dd>
	<dt>Jawi <i>gāf</i> <span lang="ar">ݢ ـݢ ـݢـ ݢـ</span></dt>
	<dd>This is used for /g/ in Malay. It is based on the Jawi variant of <i>kāf</i> with a dot.</dd>
	<dt>Moroccan <i>gāf</i> <span lang="ar">ݣ ـݣ ـݣـ ݣـ</span></dt>
	<dd>This is yet another letter used for /g/, this time in Morocco.</dd>
	<dt>Pashtun <i>gāf</i> <span lang="ar">ګـ ـګـ ـګ ګ</span></dt>
	<dd>This is another representation of /g/, used in Pashto.</dd>
	<dt><i>"zhayn"</i> <span lang="ar">ـژ ژ</span></span></dt>
	<dd>This represents /ʒ/, the sound of French <i>i</i>, also found in English as the <i>s</i> in <i>treasure</i>. It is used in Iranian and Indian languages, but never in Arabic.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>The main numeral system in Arabic is the same as in Europe; in fact the European numerals were introduced from the Maghreb, and the Maghreb uses exactly the same numerals as Eurpean languages. Multi-digit numerals have the normal order (i.e. 21 is twenty-one, not twelve), although since Arabic script is written right-to-left, from a writer's perspective you write them with the smallest digit first rather than biggest digit first as in the Latin alphabet. There is lots of regional variation in the numerals; here are the sets encoded separately by Unicode:</p>
<table>
	<tr><th>Western</th><th>Easterm</th><th>Persian</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td><span lang="ar">٠</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۰</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td><span lang="ar">١</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۱</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td><span lang="ar">٢</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۲</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td><span lang="ar">٣</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۳</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td><span lang="ar">٤</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۴</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td><span lang="ar">٥</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۵</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td><span lang="ar">٦</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۶</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td><span lang="ar">٧</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۷</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td><span lang="ar">٨</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۸</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>9</td><td><span lang="ar">٩</span></td><td><span lang="ar">۹</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are also numbers based on the alphabet itself, like Greek numbers. The order is as follows:</p>
<table>
