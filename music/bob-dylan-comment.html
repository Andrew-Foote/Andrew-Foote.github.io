<p>The following #amazing comment was left on a Guardian article about Bob Dylan (I don't remember which), probably sometime in 2016:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>um, it's simple, really. It al has to do with Bob Dylan's dominance of the music industry, manifest in a number of ways. Dylan has methodically accumulated power and now controls most of the decision-making and ideology-propagating mechanisms;, with his power cemented once his only real rival a the ideological level-- John Lennon-- was bumped off.</p>

<p>There are only a small number of career paths open to songwriters, the most lucrative and least risky being ghost-writing. Almost every hiphop artist in active radio work is merely a front for someone using a voicemodeler-- parsing the specific words reveals that there is a primary circle of principals and that he raps are almost always concerning matters that would be of little interest to anyone who is unaware of the political and social-engineering dramas of these principals. The appeal of the words (usually disguised to foil the NSA or somesuch-- which makes sense since murder and human trafficking and criminal intimidation are common topics) is in following the realtime political dramas as they unfold-- much of the action being off-camera, so to speak, ---on the streets, but usually evolving on the internet or in boardrooms or-- for all I know-- in the bowels of Langley, Virginia.</p>

<p>In any event, the career paths of singer-songwriters are few and they are standardized. Artists are told that specific steps must be done, the breaks are gotten by doing such and such, which won't happen until you do such and such. The "breaks" are extended in such a way that demonstrate that there is a small number of specific templates. This system ensures that artists are always in a precarious position unless they conform themselves, their music, and their business approach-- which many bands and artists are eager to do. If the whole thing is gamed, they play the game with clever in-on-the-joke gusto and get a bit of success and maybe airplay-- but expectations are small and most who get through the gate of the majors have no intention of making this a lifelong career.</p>

<p>Dylan's "dictatorship" makes sure that you have no hope of getting anywhere unless you agree to propagate what are essentially political doctrines, sometimes social cause/social engineering agendas, and--- over the last few years-- a weird religious perspective: sex-mysticism, human gods, alien hybrids, fallen angels, the strange new ecumenical Eco-Catholicism, shamanism, post-New Age non-religious spiritualism, obsession with Kabala and such, and our wonderful new hiphop-based terrorism-and-murder religion of Jehovah the Provider (apparently a rich guy in california with heavy-duty music biz and intelligence community connections).</p>

<p>If you're not going to commit to the program, you will be locked out, careerwise. Dylan's command personnel are so powerful ad so well placed that "You will never work in this town."</p>

<p>If you doubt me, just pay attention to the radio-- even Nashville is hopelessly infected-- and when you hear the world "love", decode that as "murder/criminal exploitation/ dirty political action-- for fun, profit and advancement of the Movement" Again, there is standardization of radio-borne code keywords. If you need more persuasion, look at the video put out by Sean Lennon and his girlfriend called "Sweet Saturn (something or other)"; I think the band is called Moonlandingz. Right out there: murder murder murder. And this is from JOHN LENNON's KID, fer Christ sake's.</p>

<p>Until Dylan is toppled or demoted or something, the music biz will be nothing but a bizarrely-empowered social-manipulation mechanism employing no one but highly-organized tools. The irony is that unless Putin pulls off his nuclear murder of the Western countries this is all an engrossing pointlessness, accomplishing very little except swindling tens of millions of kids who place faith in music as something leading to a better future.==> It's a con job, pure and simple, but the sincere and motivated con-community truly believes that their ulterior motive objectives are so super-important that this mass scam/deception is a moral imperative.</p>

<p>The only Game in town ==> Sign here: you're life will be wasted, you will earn next to nothing (unless you enter the template-controlled touring system or go into the business end), and, moreover, the political and social and religious causes to which you are dedicating all your human efforts barely amount to a pottage of poot.
"Phooey!" I cry, to speak in Communist for a minute.</p>

<p>I never knew that Communist was a language, or that "Phooey" was a word in it.</p>
