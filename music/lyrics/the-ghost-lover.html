<h1>The Ghost Lover</h1>

<h2>Karen James ("The Ghost Lover", 1961)</h2>

<p>Johnny, he promised to marry me,<br>
but I fear he's with some fair one and gone.<br>
There's something bewails him and I don't know what it is<br>
and I'm weary of lying alone.</p>

<p>Johnny, he came there at the appointed hour,<br>
and he tapped on the window so slow.<br>
This fair maid arose, and she hurried on her clothes,<br>
and she bade her true love welcome home.</p>

<p>She took him by the hand and she laid him down.<br>
She felt he was cold as the clay<br>
She said, "My dearest dear, if I only had my way,<br>
this long night would never turn to day.</p>

<p>"Crow up, crow up, my little bird,<br>
and don't crow before it is day;<br>
and your cage shall be made of the glittering gold<br>
and your doors of silver so gay.</p>

<p>"Where is your bed of soft down, my love?<br>
And where is your white holland sheet?<br>
And where is the fair maid who watches over you<br>
as you lie in your long dreamless sleep?"</p>

<p>"The sand is my soft bed of down, my love;<br>
the sea is my white holland sheet.<br>
The long, hungry worms, they do feed off of me<br>
as I lie every night in the deep.</p>

<p>"Oh, when shall I see you, my love," she cried,<br>
"And when shall I see you again?"<br>
"When little fishes fly and the seas, they do dry<br>
and the hard rocks do melt in the sun.</p>
