<h1>Diego's Bold Shore</h1>

<h2>Alpheus Hyatt Verill (in <i>The Deep Sea Hunters</i>)</h2>

<p>'Twas a love of adventure, and a longing for gold,<br>
and a hardened desire to roam<br>
tempted me far away o'er the watery world,<br>
far away from my kindred and home.</p>

<p>With a storm-beaten cap'n, so fearless and bold,<br>
and a score of brave fellows or two,<br>
far away to the hardships, the hunger and cold<br>
sailed this fearless and jovial crew.</p>

<p>Have you ever cruised on Diego's bold shores<br>
that are washed by the Antarctic wave?<br>
Where the white-plumed albatross merrily soars<br>
o'er many a poor whaler's grave?</p>

<p>Did you ever hear tell of that mighty sperm whale<br>
that, when boldly attacked in his lair,<br>
with one sweep of his mighty and ponderous tail<br>
sends the whaleboat so high in the air?</p>

<p>Did you ever join in those heart-wringing cheers,<br>
with your face turned towards Heaven's blue dome,<br>
as, laden with riches you purchased so dear,<br>
you hoisted your topsails, bound home?</p>

<h2>Waterson:Carthy ("Diego's Bold Shore", "A Dark Light", 2002)</h2>

<p>Has a love of adventure, a promise of gold<br>
or an ardent desire to roam<br>
ever tempted you far o'er the watery world<br>
and away from your kindred and home?<br>

<p>With a storm-beaten captain, free-hearted and bold,<br>
and a score of brave fellows or two,<br>
inured to the hardship of hunger and cold<br>
and a fearless and jolly good crew?</p>

<p>Have you ever stood watch where Diego's bold shore<br>
looms up from the Antarctic wave,<br>
where the snowy-plumed albatross merrily soars<br>
over many a mariner's grave?<br>
Have you heard the mastheadsman sing out, "there she blows,"<br>
seen the boats gaily leave the ship's side,<br>
or the giant fish breach 'neath the harpooner's blows<br>
till the blue sea with crimson was dyed?</p>

<p>Have you seen the foam fly when the mighty right whale,<br>
thus boldly attacked in his lair,<br>
with a terrible blow of his ponderous tail<br>
sent the boat spinning up in the air?<br>
Or where the green isles of the evergreen glades<br>
are teeming with dainties so rare?<br>
Have you ever made love 'neath the cocoa's green shade<br>
to the sweet sunny maids that dwell there?</p>

<p>Let those who delight in the comforts of home<br>
and the joys of a warm fireside,<br>
who dream it a peril the ocean to roam,<br>
in the cots of their fathers abide.<br>
Though not a day nearer we reckon our death,<br>
though daily we sport o'er our graves,<br>
no sweeter they'll slumber beneath the green sod<br>
than we in the boisterous waves.</p>

<p>Have you ever joined in in the boisterous shout,<br>
reaching far through the heaven's blue dome,<br>
when, rich in the spoils you have purchased so dear,<br>
you have hoisted your topsails for home?<br>
Or when the dark hills of Columbia arose<br>
from out the blue waves of the main?<br>
Have you ever relived the unspeakable joy<br>
of meeting with loved ones again?</p>


Johnny, he promised to marry me,<br>
but I fear he's with some fair one and gone.<br>
There's something bewails him and I don't know what it is<br>
and I'm weary of lying alone.</p>

<p>Johnny, he came there at the appointed hour,<br>
and he tapped on the window so slow.<br>
This fair maid arose, and she hurried on her clothes,<br>
and she bade her true love welcome home.</p>

<p>She took him by the hand and she laid him down.<br>
She felt he was cold as the clay<br>
She said, "My dearest dear, if I only had my way,<br>
this long night would never turn to day.</p>

<p>"Crow up, crow up, my little bird,<br>
and don't crow before it is day;<br>
and your cage shall be made of the glittering gold<br>
and your doors of silver so gay.</p>

<p>"Where is your bed of soft down, my love?<br>
And where is your white holland sheet?<br>
And where is the fair maid who watches over you<br>
as you lie in your long dreamless sleep?"</p>

<p>"The sand is my soft bed of down, my love;<br>
the sea is my white holland sheet.<br>
The long, hungry worms, they do feed off of me<br>
as I lie every night in the deep.</p>

<p>"Oh, when shall I see you, my love," she cried,<br>
"And when shall I see you again?"<br>
"When little fishes fly and the seas, they do dry<br>
and the hard rocks do melt in the sun.</p>
