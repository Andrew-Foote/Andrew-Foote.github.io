<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Andrew Foote. I was born in Liverpool in 1995, and have lived in Rainhill most of my life. From 2013 to 2016 I was at the University of York studying Linguistics and Mathematics. After graduating I spent the next year studying for a master's degree in Evolution of Language and Cognition at the University of Edinburgh, and graduated in December.</p>

<p>I am interested especially in mathematics, and in various disciplines which I think of as related, namely biology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology and history, in that they are about describing and understanding variation (in language grammars, organisms, cultures, ways of organizing society, etc.)</p>

<p>The links below showcase some of the things I've written or made relating to my interests which I think are most worthy of attention. If you click on the individual section headers, you'll be taken to a page dedicated specifically to that subject, which may contain links to other, less interesting works of mine.</p>

<h1><a href="mathematics/">Mathematics</a></h1>

<p><a href="mathematics/rational-approximation.pdf">The size of the set of the badly approximable numbers</a>. My final year project for my undergraduate degree, completed in early 2016. It's a work of mathematical exposition on the subject of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation">Diophantine approximation</a>, which develops the basic theory to the point that it can be understood what the &ldquo;badly approximable&rdquo; numbers are, and then proves two results relating to how many badly approximable numbers there are: (a) there are uncountably many, but (b) they make up a set of Lebesgue measure 0.</p>

<p><a href="mathematics/nonstandard-reals.html">A nonstandard construction of the real numbers</a>. An article written during June 2018, explaining how to construct the real numbers using nonstandard analysis.</p>

<h1><a href="linguistics/">Linguistics</a></h1>

<p>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">conlangs</a> for the <a href="http://akana.conlang.org/wiki/Main_Page">Akana</a> collaborative conworld: <a href="http://akana.conlang.org/wiki/Ìletlégbàku">Ìletlégbàku</a> (spring 2010) and Wendoth (<a href="http://akana.conlang.org/w/index.php?title=Wendoth&oldid=7081">v. 1.0</a>, summer 2010&ndash;winter 2011; <a href="http://akana.conlang.org/wiki/Wendoth">v. 2.0</a>, unfinished, spring 2015).</p>

<p><a href="linguistics/noun-classes.pdf">Noun classes across different languages</a>. An essay I wrote as an exercise at the end of Year 12 in 2012 on various aspects of noun classes as a linguistic phenomenon: what sort of noun classes there are, how common they are, what role they serve, etc.</p>

<h1><a href="biology/">Biology</a></h1>

<p><a href="biology/ornithology/BIRD-CHECKLIST.ods">My bird checklist</a>. Contains all the birds that regularly occur in the British Isles, including scarce migrants (but not vagrants), plus lots of additional data (e.g. rarity data from BirdTrack).</p>

<p><a href="biology/ornithology/birdsong">My birdsong player</a>. I'm not very good at identifying birds from their song, so I made this to help me&mdash;it's a little radio that will play the songs of birds that inhabit the British Isles, and will give you a notification when the next song plays even if you're on another tab, so that you always know which bird's song is being played.</p>

<p><a href="biology/collection">My collection of pictures of organisms</a>. I like to go out looking for wildlife and to take pictures of it, and to keep track of which species I still haven't yet managed to see. This page is where I put the pictures. It's organized by phylogeny, so it also works as a checklist.</p>

<p><a href="biology/evolution-domestic-dog.pdf">The evolution of the domestic dog</a>. An essay I wrote as an exercise at the end of Year 12 in 2012 on the evolution of the domestic dog, and what its wild ancestor might be (I think a lot of new research has been done on this topic recently&mdash;maybe I will revise the essay one day!)</p>
