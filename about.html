<h1>About</h1>

<p>I was born in Liverpool in 1995 and have lived in nearby Rainhill from an early age. In 2013 I began studying for a bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Mathematics at the University of York, and I graduated in 2016. I then completed a one-year master's course in Evolution of Language and Cognition at the University of Edinburgh. Currently I'm seeking work!</p>

<p>I blog at <a href="https://thehousecarpenter.wordpress.com">The House Carpenter</a> and Tumblr at <a href="http://house-carpenter.tumblr.com">house-carpenter</a>. In both places I post about whatever I'm interested in at the moment, which is most often something to do with linguistics or mathematics, which I guess are my two &ldquo;fields&rdquo;. Although I've never studied it at university, I have another fairly strong academic interest in anthropology. Non-academic interests include natural history and folk music.</p>

<p>This website is for anything I feel like making public which doesn't seem suitable to put on my blog or Tumblr, or which is too inconvenient to put into that format, such as really long essays (although don't take that as a guarantee that I'll be writing any of those), or mathematical notes which are a nightmare to get into the right format for WordPress (this is my <em>real</em> reason for making this website).</p>
