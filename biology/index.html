<h1>Natural history</h1>

<p><a href="biology/ornithology/BIRD-CHECKLIST.ods">My bird checklist</a>. Contains all the birds that regularly occur in the British Isles, including scarce migrants (but not vagrants), plus lots of additional data (e.g. rarity data from BirdTrack).</p>

<p><a href="biology/ornithology/birdsong">My birdsong player</a>. I'm not very good at identifying birds from their song, so I made this to help me&mdash;it's a little radio that will play the songs of birds that inhabit the British Isles, and will give you a notification when the next song plays even if you're on another tab, so that you always know which bird's song is being played.</p>

<p><a href="biology/collection">My collection of pictures of organisms</a>. I like to go out looking for wildlife and to take pictures of it, and to keep track of which species I still haven't yet managed to see. This page is where I put the pictures. It's organized by phylogeny, so it also works as a checklist.</p>

<p><a href="biology/evolution-domestic-dog.pdf">The evolution of the domestic dog</a>. An essay I wrote as an exercise at the end of Year 12 in 2012 on the evolution of the domestic dog, and what its wild ancestor might be (I think a lot of new research has been done on this topic recently&mdash;maybe I will revise the essay one day!)</p>
