<h1>Andrew's Phylogeny Archive</h1>

<p>Here you can find some phylogenetic trees I've typed up. I have tried to follow the most recent molecular phylogenies, and have included only living species. See <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~mhaaramo/">Mikko's Phylogeny Archive</a> for a much more complete archive which also includes extinct species.</p>

<p>Currently, the root is at <a href="mammalia.html">Mammalia</a>.</p>
